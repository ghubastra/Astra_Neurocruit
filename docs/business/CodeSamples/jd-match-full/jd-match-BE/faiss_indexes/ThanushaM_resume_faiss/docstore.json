medical equipment. \nPROJECTS \nFAKE NEWS DETECTION USING OPEN-SOURCE PYTHON MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARIES \n•Using open-source Python libraries, created an application that can detect whether a given piece of news text \nis real or fake. \n•\nUsed sklearn library to extract the Tf-Idf vector from the given text, which is piped into a classifier model. \n•Used an open-source labelled dataset for training and testing the classifier model. \n•\nPython libraries used were — numpy, sklearn, and jupyter. \nBRAIN TUMOUR DETECTION USING DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING — BACHELORS THESIS WORK, 2020 \n•Using digitally processed MRI scans of brain images, we created an application to detect whether the tumour \nis benign or malignant. \n•The algorithm uses an SVM classifier on a feature set extracted using K-means clustering. \n•\nDeveloped the algorithm on Matlab using existing ML libraries. \n•Collaborated with 3 of my peers to execute and present the project to the thesis evaluation panel.","metadata":{"source":"/tmp/resume-processor-nRDEgV/ThanushaM_resume.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.3","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Resume

2019 \n•\nUsing temperature, humidity, UV, and PM2.5 sensors, created an active weather monitoring unit on Raspberry \nPi that can monitor and alert on various weather parameters based on configured thresholds. \n•Used Python scripts to interface the unit, pushing the values periodically into a central database that can be \nqueried from the internet. \n•Collaborated with 3 of my classmates to execute and present the project to a college-wide forum. \nSKILLS \n•Programming — Python, C \n•Databases — MySQL \n•Libraries & Frameworks — Django, sklearn, numpy \n•Tools — VS Code, PyCharm,
